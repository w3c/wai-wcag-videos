## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:07 | Gopal has mild dementia. Some websites and apps require information that is difficult for him to remember right away. | Gopal (older male) is engaged while browsing on a tablet computer. At some point his flow is interrupted as he tries to remember information he needs to enter (we see that next). |
| 2 | 0:07 - 0:15 | For example, this website asks for invoice and shipping addresses, account and item numbers, and other information. It takes him a long time to complete all these entries. | He puts down the tablet computer, and gets up to look into his notes (eg. post-it, note book, papers, etc.). We see a form on the screen with many entries (home address, shipping address, etc.). Gopal completed several entries, with others still remaininging (eg. account number, item numbers, etc.). |
| 3 | 0:15 - 0:24 | Sometimes he is automatically logged out when he takes too long looking up the information to enter. This is very discouraging for him, and often makes him want to give up. | Some indication that some time has lapsed while he was looking up the information. Just as he finished collecting his notes and sits back down to continue typing, we see the session expire (he gets logged out automatically). He looks annoyed/frustrated. |
| 4 | 0:24 - 0:33 | Websites and apps are more accessible for Gopal when they save the information he has entered before logging him out. When he logs back in, the information he previously typed is still available. | We see the screen as he logs in again, and the form re-appears with all the data that was previously there. |
