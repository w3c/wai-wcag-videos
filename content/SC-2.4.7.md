## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:12 | Alex has repetitive strain injury, which makes it painful to use a mouse and to type for extended periods of time. | Alex sitting in an office and working on a desktop computer. He flexes his wrists to relieve discomfort from typing. |
| 2 | 0:12 - 0:21 | He uses an ergonomic keyboard to browse websites and to type short pieces of text. Specifically, he uses the Tab-key to jump between links, form fields, and other controls. | Zoom to show the ergonomic keyboard. He is not typing anymore but using the Tab-key to move through a form with many entries. |
| 3 | 0:21 - 0:30 | Good websites indicate the currently active links and controls, for example as a clearly visible rectangle around to highlight links and controls. | We see the screen and a clear focus indicator moving from one form field to the next as he presses the Tab-key. |
| 4 | 0:30 - 0:38 | Some websites do not provide such indicators, which makes it difficult for him to know where the focus is on the page. | Same scene with another website with no focus indicator. Alex looks confused/lost then dismayed/frustrated (he is tapping the tab key but not seeing the indicator on the screen). |
| 5 | 0:38 - 0:46 | Alex can use websites with clear focus indicators much more effectively, and avoids sites with no indicators whenever possible. | Back to the website with good focus indicator; we see Alex happier while using the Tab-key and typing away on his computer. |
