## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Alex has been a reporter for many years and has developed a repetitive strain injury, which makes it painful to use a mouse and to type for extended periods of time. | Alex sitting in an office and working on a desktop computer. He flexes his wrists to relieve discomfort from typing. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | He uses an ergonomic keyboard to browse websites and to type short pieces of text. For longer passages of text, such as his article, her prefers to use dictation software that converts his speech to text. [We hear Alex speak into his heaset dictating a news article] | We see Alex put on a headset and start to use the computer via voice. We see the screen and the text is appearing as he speaks. It is a news article that he is dictating. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | The content management system that he using to publish his articles has keyboard shortcuts. He likes to use these because they are easier and quicker to use by keyboard and by voice. For example, typing or saying the letter "P" triggers the "Publish" command. | We see Alex pressing the letter "P" on his keyboard, and a success message appears on the screen "Article Published!". |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | However, these keyboard shortcuts can sometimes get mistakenly triggered when he is using his dictation software. For example, if is spelling a word with the letter "P" or saying something that sounds similar to it. [We hear Alex saying "P-O-box"] | We see the content management system again with a different article being written. While Alex is dictating, the article is mistakenly published and we see the "Article Published!" message again. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Fortunately his content management system allows him to configure the different keyboard shortcuts. Alex configured these in such a way, that he now needs to activate the Shift-key while pressing or saying the letter "P", to actually trigger the "Publish" command. | We see configuration seetings (list of commands and input fields beside them of the shortcut keys to trigger these commands), and we see Alex changing the setting for the command "Publish". |
