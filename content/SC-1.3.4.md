## Background

* [Understanding SC 1.3.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/orientation.html)
* [Script Outline for SC 1.3.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Video-Based_Resources/WCAG_Requirements#SC1-3-4)
* [Survey Results for SC 1.3.4](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35532/Videos_WCAG_Squirrel/results#xSC134)

## Notes

* Initial description: [Person with cerebral palsy using tablet mounted on wheelchair can use the app because it does not rely on a particular orientation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/#134-orientation-aa)
* Updated description: [Jan](https://wai-wcag-videos.netlify.app/overview/#jan-he) is able to use the app on a tablet mounted to the wheelchair because orientation can be switched off

## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Jan has cerebral palsy, which, in his case, limits his mobility including use of his arms. | Jan is using a wheelchair (power chair) with a headrest and seatbelt to support him from the involuntary movement of his arms and legs. |
| 2 | 0:@@ - @:@@ | He has a stand for his tablet computer, where he can switch between portrait and landscape orientation. This makes it easier for him to use different apps. | We zoom out to see Jan is sitting at a table with a tablet computer mounted to a stand. He pushes the corner of the tablet and it rotates on that stand. |
| 3 | @:@@ - @:@@ | For example, the landscape orientation allows for longer sentences, which he finds more comfortable for reading articles. | We see the tablet screen as it rotates, and the app changes display to provide longer sentences. Jan is reading an article. |
| 4 | @:@@ - @:@@ | However, when he is out and about, the tablet is fixed on his wheelchair and he cannot change its orientation. | We see a personal assistant remove the tablet from the stand and mount it to the wheelchair, and Jan leaves in his power chair. |
| 5 | @:@@ - @:@@ | This newspaper app only works in portrait orientation, so Jan can not read the articles when the tablet is mounted on his wheelchair. | We see the screen mounted in landscape orientation with the text in a newspaper app appearing in portrait (sideways for him). |
| 6 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Fortunately his favorite newspaper app works well in both orientations, and does not require him to use any particular one. | We see Jan switching to another newspaper app that works well in landscape orientation while Jan is cruising away. |
