* [Understanding SC 1.3.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/orientation.html)

* [Survey Results for SC 1.3.4](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35532/Videos_WCAG_Squirrel/results#xSC134)

## Notes

* Initial description: [Person with cerebral palsy using tablet mounted on wheelchair can use the app because it does not rely on a particular orientation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/#134-orientation-aa)
* Updated description: [Jan](https://wai-wcag-videos.netlify.app/overview/#jan-he) is able to use the app on a tablet mounted to the wheelchair because orientation can be switched off

## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Jan has cerebral palsy, which, in his case, means limited use of his arms. | Jan is using a wheelchair (power chair) with a headrest and seatbelt to support him from the involuntary movement of his arms and legs. |
| 2 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Jan uses a tablet mounted on his wheelchair. In his case it is fixed to landscape orientation and he cannot change this orientation. | We zoom in on the tablet mounted to his wheelchair. |
| 3 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Unfortunately some apps only work in portrait orientation, so Jan can not read the articles when the tablet is mounted on his wheelchair. | We see the screen mounted in landscape orientation with the text in an app appearing in portrait (sideways for him). |
| 4 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Apps work well for Jan when they do not require him to use any particular orientation. Such apps work for him while he is using the wheelchair and elsewhere. | We see Jan switching to another app that works well in landscape orientation. |
