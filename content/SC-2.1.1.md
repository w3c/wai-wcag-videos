## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Niando has muscular dystrophy, which also impacts her arms. She uses voice commands to operate the computer and speech recognition software to type text. [We hear Naindo say the commands "open email" and "write message"] | We see Niando who uses a wheelchair with sip-and-puff system. She has a headset and using speech to operate the computer. We the screen and the email application opening and the message being started as she speaks the commands. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | For this to work properly, applications need to support the keyboard interface. For example, in this email application users can add attachments to an email using drag-and-drop with a mouse. | Zoom in to part of the application called "attachments" with the drag-and-drop symbol. The "open file" is not very evident at first. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Like many other people, Niando doesn't use a mouse. | We see Niando and her setup again. @@@ Maybe also people from other videos if feasible @@@ |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Luckily this application also allows Niando to select a file without drag-and-drop. [We hear Niando say the command "send message"] | We see Niando completing the file select process (with the usual dialog windows) and finally her sending off the email. |
