## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Ilya is blind. Like many other blind computer users, she does not read Braille. She listens to a screen reader reading aloud what is on the screen instead. | Ilya is in an office space working at a desktop computer. She has headphones connected to the computer. |
| 2 | 0:@@ - @:@@ | [We hear the screen reader starting to read a web page] | We see Ilya's screen while she is navigating in a web page. The actions on the screen match the audio we hear from the screen reader. |
| 3 | @:@@ - @:@@ | When structures on a page are coded correctly, they are announced by the screen reader. For example, headings, lists, links, and table cells are properly announced. [We hear the screen reader announce a heading then a list under that heading] | We continue to see the screen, and the individual page structures being highlighted by the screen reader as they are being read aloud. |
| 4 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Sometimes developers do not use the correct mark-up, and the structure becomes unclear. For example, this text looks like a heading but it is not coded correctly, so it is not announced as a heading. [We hear the screen reader read text without announcing it as a heading] | We see a similar heading to the one shown earlier; it is highlighted by the screen reader as it is being read aloud (but this time it is not announced as a heading). |
| 5 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Fortunately the content management system used at her company generates good mark-up. In particular, for the many tables that Ilya needs to use. They are coded so well that she can also use them with her tablet computer and mobile phone when she is traveling. | We see Ilya on the go with the same headphones from the beginning but now attached to a mobile device (tablet or phone) that she is using. |
