## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Ilya is the chief accountant at an insurance company. She lost sight as an adult due to untreated diabetes. | Ilya is an office space working at a desktop computer. She has headphones connected to the computer. |
| 2 | 0:@@ - @:@@ | Like many other blind computer users, she does not read Braille. She listens to the screen reader reading aloud what's on the screen instead. [We hear the screen reader starting to read a web page] | We see Ilya's screen while she is navigating to the web page. |
| 3 | @:@@ - @:@@ | When structures on a page are coded correctly, they are announced by the screen reader. For example, headings, lists, links, and table cells are properly announced. [We hear the screen reader announce a heading then a list under that heading] | We continue to see the screen, and the individual page structures being highlighted by the screen reader as they are being read aloud. |
| 4 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Sometimes developers do not use the correct mark-up, and the structure becomes unclear. For example, this text looks like a heading but it is not coded correctly, so it is not announced. [We hear the screen reader read text without announcing it as a heading] | We see a similar heading to the one shown earlier; it is highlighted by the screen reader as it is being read aloud (but this time it is not announced as a heading). |
| 5 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Fortunately the content management system used at her company generates good mark-up, also for the many tables that Ilya needs to use. They are coded so well that she can also use them with her tablet computer and mobile phone when she is traveling. | We see Ilya on the go with the same headphones from the beginning but now attached to a mobile device (tablet or phone) that she is using. |
