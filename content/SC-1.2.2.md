## Notes

* Initial description: Person who is hard of hearing is provided with captions for a video with audio
* Updated description: [Martine](https://wai-wcag-videos.netlify.app/overview/#martine-she) experiencing good captions, no captions, and automatic captions, as she follows an online course. Key aspects of the SC, such as indicating audio information, is also presented.

## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:09 | Martine is hard of hearing. She can hear some sounds with her hearing aid but not enough to understand speech. | Frontal view of Martine's face moving around and away from her, to see her from behind sitting at a desk and working on a computer. She has a hearing aid that is visible from this angle. (similar approach to [Captions - Perspectives Video](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/captions/)). |
| 2 | 0:09 - 0:19 | She is currently taking an online college course. Most course videos have captions, which Martine uses to know what is being said. | Zoom in on computer screen to find a video playing. Zoom further to the captions appearing in the video. |
| 3 | 0:19 - 0:27 | The captions also convey important audio information, such as who is speaking, clapping, and laughter. This helps convey the context and overall tone in the audio. | Clapping and switch of speakers indicated in the captions, reflecting the video playing. |
| 4 | 0:27 - 0:34 | Unfortunately some videos do not have captions, making them not usable for Martine. | Martine opens another video and tries clicking the disabled closed captions button. Martine looks disappointed. |
| 5 | 0:34 - 0:40 | Also videos with automatically-generated captions are not usable for Martine. They are generally too inaccurate for her to rely on. | Martine turns on automatic captions, and we see a captioned sentence that obviously does not make sense. |
| 6 | 0:40 - 0:46 | Thankfully the university is now adding proper captions to all the videos that Martine has in her course. | Reverse of scene 1: view from behind Martine sitting at her desk and watching a video moves around to see frontal view of Martine's face -- she is engaged with the video. |
