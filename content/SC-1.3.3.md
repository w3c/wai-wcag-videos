## Background

* [Success Criterion 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#sensory-characteristics)
* [Understanding SC 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/sensory-characteristics.html)
* [Script Outline for SC 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Video-Based_Resources/WCAG_Requirements#SC1-3-3)
* [Survey Results for SC 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35532/Videos_WCAG_Squirrel/results#xSC133)

## Notes

* Initial description: Person with low vision using re-flowed content due to text-resizing understands which button to press (button was beside and is now below the instruction/text)
* Updated description: [Kaseem](https://wai-wcag-videos.netlify.app/overview/#kaseem-she) is able to find the buttons after text-resizing because the instructions do not rely on the location on the screen

## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Kaseem loves to use the computer to stay in touch with her friends. She is legally blind with partial vision. At home she has a large screen and uses a software that magnifies the screen and increases the text size. | Kaseem is sitting in front of her computer setup. We see the large screen with very large text. She is browsing around the page and leaning in to read passages of text, then browse around again to find a button elsewhere on the page and press it. |
| 2 | 0:@@ - @:@@ | Increasing the text size means that paragraphs, buttons, and other page components may appear in different positions, especially since many websites use responsive design techniques. | We see a webpage on the screen with the text size slowly increasing, and things moving around on the page as the different break-points are reached (eg. a sidebar with buttons is initially beside the text, then goes under to allow more space for the larger text). |
| 3 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Sometimes instructions say things like "press the button on the left" or "on the right", which are confusing because they actually appear above or below the text on her computer. | We first see the instruction "press the button on the right to continue" on Kaseem's screen, then she browses around the page looking for that button. |
| 4 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Also instructions like "press the green button" and "say your name after you hear the beep" are not useful for her because she cannot see some colors very well and cannot hear sound. | We see Kaseem looking a little confused and frustrated trying to find the button from earlier. |
| 5 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Better instruction would be "press the button at the end of this form", which does not rely on color, sound, location or other sensory characteristics. | We see the sentence change from "press the button on the right" to "press the button at the end of this form" and Kaseem from the previous scene looking much more relieved while she finds and presses the button. |
