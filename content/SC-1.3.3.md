This page provides the script for Success Criterion 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics of the [WCAG 2 Videos](https://wai-wcag-videos.netlify.app/overview/).

## Background

* [Success Criterion 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#sensory-characteristics)
* [Understanding SC 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/sensory-characteristics.html)
* [Script Outline for SC 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Video-Based_Resources/WCAG_Requirements#SC1-3-3)
* [Survey Results for SC 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35532/Videos_WCAG_Squirrel/results#xSC133)

## Notes

* Initial description: Person with low vision using re-flowed content due to text-resizing understands which button to press (button was beside and is now below the instruction/text)
* Updated description: [Kaseem](https://wai-wcag-videos.netlify.app/overview/#kaseem-she) is able to find the buttons after text-resizing because the instructions do not rely on the location on the screen

## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Kaseem is deaf and legally blind with partial vision. At home she has a large screen and she uses a software that @@@ magnifies the content / increases the text size @@@. | Kaseem is sitting in front of her computer setup. We see the large screen with very large text. She browses around the page and leans in to read passages of text, then browses around again to find a button elsewhere on the page and press it. |
| 2 | 0:@@ - @:@@ | Due to this @@@ magnification / increasing of text size @@@, paragraphs, buttons, and other page components may appear in different positions than usual. This happens frequently, in particular on websites that use responsive design techniques. | We see a webpage on the screen with the text size slowly increasing. Things are moving around on the page as the text reflows and the different break-points are reached. We see paragraphs of text, buttons, and other page components move around the page (eg. a sidebar initially beside the text, then goes under it to allow more space for the larger text). |
| 3 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Sometimes instructions on websites say things like "press the button on the left" or "on the right", which are confusing because they actually appear above or below the text on her computer. | We first see the instruction "press the button on the right to continue" on Kaseem's screen, then she browses around the page looking for that button. |
| 4 | @:@@ - @:@@ | A better instruction would be "press the OK button at the end of this form". This does not rely on sensory characteristics, such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation or sound. | We see the sentence change from "press the button on the right" to "press the OK button at the end of this form" and Kaseem from the previous scene looking much more relieved while she finds and presses the button. |
