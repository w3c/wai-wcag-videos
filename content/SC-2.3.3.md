## Notes

* Initial description: Person with vestibular disorder can turn off motion animations to avoid nausea
* Updated description: [Manti](https://wai-wcag-videos.netlify.app/overview/#manti-she), has vestibular disorder, can turn off motion animations that are triggered by interaction

## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:08 | Manti has a condition called vestibular disorder, which makes her nauseous and dizzy from certain types of animations. | Manti (young female) is using her mobile app outside while on the go. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:15 | The swiveling icons that appear when she presses buttons on this app is an example of such animations. | Zoom onto the screen of the mobile phone. We see search results and a "Next" button at the bottom. Focus on the button and we see her thumb pressing it. Some of the animation starts but not all of it, to avoid reaction for viewers with sensitivities. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:23 | Some types of animations can cause serious reactions, including migranes and seizures. | We see her moving her head away from the screen and turning the phone to avoid the animation. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:31 | Fortunately Manti found a different app that provides the same functionality and that she can safely use. | Back to the screen, with Manti using a similar but different app without swiveling animations. |
