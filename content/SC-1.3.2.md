## Background

* [Success Criterion 1.3.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#meaningful-sequence)
* [Understanding SC 1.3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/meaningful-sequence.html)
* [Script Outline for SC 1.3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Video-Based_Resources/WCAG_Requirements#SC1-3-2)
* [Survey Results for SC 1.3.2](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35532/Videos_WCAG_Squirrel/results#xSC132)

## Notes

* Initial description: Person with aphasia hears screen reader output that matches the visual sequence
* Updated description: [Preety](https://wai-wcag-videos.netlify.app/overview/#preety-she) is able to use a screen reader to help her read because the visual order matches the order in the code

## Script

| Scene | Time | Audio | Visual |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:@@ | Preety is a middle school student who enjoys literature class in particular. She has substantial difficulty reading due to dyslexia. | Preety is reading a printed book at a desk at home, and appearing to have difficulty with that (eg. following the text with her finger and leaning in to the book). |
| 2 | 0:@@ - @:@@ | She uses electronic books with text-to-speech software that reads the text and highlights it at the same time. [We hear the screen reader read aloud part of a sentence.] | We see passages of text on a tablet computer, and the individual words are being highlighted one by one as they are read aloud. |
| 3 | @:@@ - @:@@ | She can read much more quickly when she can hear and see the text at the same time. | We see Preety reading on a tablet computer and looking much more relieved and content. |
| 4 | @:@@ - @:@@ | Unfortunately, sometimes the reading order isn't coded correctly. The text appears correctly but the reading software jumps around the page in a confusing order. | We see the screen again, and focus on the text highlighting jump from a paragraph to a sidebar instead of to the next paragraph then back again to the next paragraph. Pretty is irritated by this jumping around. |
| 5 | @:@@ - @:@@ | When developers properly code the correct reading order, the reading sequence is meaningful and Preety can enjoy her literature class. | Same scene as before but this time the text highlighting moves directly to the next paragraph (which is the last paragraph in the section), then to the sidebar after that. |
