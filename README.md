# Overview

This repository contains scripts for short videos explaining WCAG 2 requirements (Success Criteria and Guidelines).

**[Overview on featured personas and WCAG requirements](https://wai-wcag-videos.netlify.app/overview/)**

## Purpose

The purpose of these videos is to:

1. Provide a concise alternative to the text content in [Understanding WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/) documents
2. Make WCAG requirements more *human* and tangible by showing real people and situations
3. Support different training, awareness-raising, promotion, and advocacy purposes

The videos are intended to explain the requirement only, in as short time as possible. They are *not* intended to explain the overal benefits of accessibility or of the requirement, exhaustively cover all disabilities and situations, or to explain assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.

## Development Process and Feedback

Feedback is welcome during any stage of the development process. Please [raise issues](https://github.com/w3c/wai-wcag-videos/issues/new/) with your feedback and suggestions.

### What to Review

- Conceptual issues (ie. is the script technically accurate?)
- Scope creep (ie. is the script going beyond the requirement?)
- Suggested additions (ie. is the script coverage insufficient?)
- Conciseness (ie. is the script as short as possible?)
- Realistic (ie. is the script providing a realistic example?)
- Necessary (ie. is it necessary to cover this requirement as a video?)
- Description of visuals (ie. does the audio sufficiently describe all important visual information?)
- Spelling, grammar, wording, and other editorial aspects

### What *Not* to review

- Names of people, age, ethnicity, etc. (will be reviewed later)
- Overall coverage of disabilities, tools, etc. (will also be reviewed later)
- Camera angles, sceneries, etc. (professional production will be engaged)
